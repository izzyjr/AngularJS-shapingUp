// 2.8 Using TabController
// To connect our controller to our page, we're going to need a few directives.
// Try to figure out which ones to use, but if you get stuck we'll give you hints along the way.
// We've provided all the HTML for you. Try to accomplish the following tasks:

// 1.) Attach the TabController to the <section> element with the .tab class. Don't forget to also add an alias.
// 2.) Trigger the setTab method when a link inside a tab is clicked. 
// Add this to each of the tab links. Pass in the number of the tab, in this case 1, 2 or 3.
// 3.) Use the isSet method to show the corresponding tab. 
// You'll need to add a directive to each of the <div> elements in .tab.
// 4.) Add the active class to the correct <li> when each tab is clicked.
// You'll need to add a directive to each <li> in .nav.
// 5.) Within the Description tab, output the product's description within the <blockquote> element.
// 6.) Within the Specs tab, output the product's shine value.
// It should look something like this within the <blockquote> element: "Shine: 4".

// 2.9 Creating Gallery Controller
// Now that you're such a whiz with tabbed tab, can you apply what you've learned to our image gallery, too?
// Don't worry, we'll start slow… And there's a lot more in common than you might think!

// 1.) Let's start with a Controller, just like last time. Call it GalleryController.
// 2.) Initialize a current property of GalleryController with a value of 0.
// 3.) Add a method to GalleryController called setCurrent that accepts a value and assigns it to current. 
// If no value is passed in, set current to 0.
